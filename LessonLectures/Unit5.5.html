<strong><bold>Unit 5.5: ArrayList Methods</bold></strong> 

<br>
<div style="font-size:2vw;">
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Methods</strong>
<br>
Unlike arrays, the ArrayList provides methods to access, 
manipulate, remove, and add data. 
<br>These methods are fundamental to using ArrayLists, 
and you are required to memorize them
 for the AP exam. 
This might seem a bit daunting, but you will quickly see how EASY 
and straight-forward these methods are.
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Adding Elements: </strong>
</div>
<br><strong>ArrayList Method: add(Obj)</strong>
<br>
<br>
This method adds an object to the end of the ArrayList. 
You CANNOT add objects that the targeted ArrayList can't store. 
For example, adding a String to a type Integer ArrayList. 
<br>
<br>
Example of using the add() method: 
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods1.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>Example Explanation:</pre>
Since the myNum ArrayList contains no objects at the time of its declaration, 
adding int 3 (an object of the Integer Class) 
will result in the last position of the ArrayList (index 0) to be updated with 3. 
The second statement will then execute, and add 5 to the end of the ArrayList at index 1.
Remember, an ArrayList is dynamic and therefore, has no established/predetermined size! 
(You will see why this size thing is very useful later).
<br>
<br>
You might be wondering: Hey! ArrayLists can only store objects, so why are you adding a primitive data type, int, to the ArrayList?!?
<br>
<br>
Well, this is possible thanks to the wonderful wrapper classes! Primitives are the objects of the class that wraps them, so you can go about with a seamless user experience!
<br>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Method: add(index, obj) </strong>
<br>
<br>
Instead of justing adding an object to the end of the ArrayList,
this method adds an object to a specified index. 
<br>
<br>
Example of .add(index, obj):
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>Example Explanation:</pre>
After adding the four characters (a, b, c, d) to the ArrayList (since code runs top down),
 the ArrayList will insert the character e at index position 1.
 Having done this, the character at index 1 will no longer be 'b', but rather,
 'e'. Note that inserting any object into an index -that is not the last position 
 of an ArrayList- will result in the incrementation of the indexes of the 
 following elements. 
 Thus, the character 'b' will get pushed into index 2, 'c' into index 3, etc.
 If you think about it, this makes perfect sense. When you insert something, 
 you push the rest down. 
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Access/Get Elements: </strong>
</div>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Method: get()</strong>
<br>
<br>
To access elements in an ArrayList, you must use the get() method 
and refer to the element's index number.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods2.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Changing Elements: </strong>
</div>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Method: set(index, Obj)</strong>
<br>
<br>
To modify an element, use must use the set() method and specify the index number.
<br>
<br>
Example of the set(index, Obj) method:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods3.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>Example Explanation:
</pre>
The code first adds the elements to the ArrayList. 
Executing the set method, the original value at index 1 
is changed to 2.1 instead. The new ArrayList will 
therefore contain the elements, 0.2, 2.1, and 4.3.
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Removing Elements: </strong>
</div>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Method: remove(index)</strong>
<br>
<br>
To remove an element, use the remove() method, and specify the index number.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods4.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>Example Explanation:
</pre>
We removed the "Mike" element at index 0 from the ArrayList. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Removing A Specific Object 
<br>
<br>
ArrayList Method: remove(obj) </strong>
<br>
<br>
This method searches through the ArrayList for the object you passed. 
If it occurs, the first occurrence of that object is removed, and true is returned.
 If the object you passed doesn't exist, false is returned, and nothing is removed. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Note* The remove methods are sometimes referred to as void methods, 
as on numerous occasions, 
you don't care what they return. You just need the element removed 
from the ArrayList. 
</i>
<br>
<br>
Example of the remove(obj) method:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods5.PNG" alt="" style="width:60%;height:60%;">
<br>
<pre>
Example Explanation:
</pre>
The first occurrence of the String "Mike" is removed from the ArrayList. 
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>LOGIC ERRORS:</strong>
</div>
<br>
You have to be extremely careful when using the remove() method, as LOGIC ERRORS might occur.
 The question below showcases this.
<br>
<br>
Question: Given an already declared ArrayList called myNum, which contains the 
Integers: 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5. 
<br> How do you remove all even digits in the myNum ArrayList?
<br>
<br>Our Solution:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods6.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<br>
This code might seem good on the surface, but it won't 
give us our desired answer! Here's why:
<br>
<br>&emsp;1) At first, i (which stands for index) is 0. 
You successfully remove the even digit 2 from the ArrayList.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The whole ArrayList now becomes: 2, 2, 2, 5, 5. 
<br>&emsp;2) i gets incremented to 1. HOWEVER! At index 1, you SKIP 
the even digit at index 0. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;You remove the even digit at index 1 for the ArrayList. 
The ArrayList now becomes: 2, 2, 5, 5
<br>&emsp;3) i gets incremented to 2. HOWEVER! 
The even digit at index 0 and 1 is SKIPPED 
and not removed. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;At index 2 of the new ArrayList: 2, 2, 5, 5, the digit is odd, 
so nothing gets removed.
<br>&emsp;4) i gets incremented to 3. At index 3, the digit is odd, 
so nothing gets removed. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The loop then finishes when i goes to 4, as 4 is 
not less than the length/size 
of the current ArrayList. 
<br>
<br>
<i>What gets outputted is an ArrayList containing the digits: 2, 2, 5, 5. 
This is not what you want!</i>
<br>
<pre>
How To Overcome This Logic Error:
</pre>
How do we avoid this tragic issue? Well, start 
backwards and not forwards so nothing gets skipped! 
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods7.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<br>
This will give us our desired ArrayList just containing odd digits: 5, 5 
<br>
Why? Trace through the loop like we did for the previous example!
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Finding The Length of The ArrayList
</div>
<br>
ArrayList Method: size( ) </strong>
<br>
<br>
This method returns how many elements are in the ArrayList, 
just like how the method <i>length </i>
 returns that for a given array.
 This is useful for traversing an ArrayList within loop iterations, 
 and for knowing how an ArrayList is dynamically changing over the course of 
 several mutations. An example of this is shown below.
<br>
<br>
Example of the size() method:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods8.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>
Example Explanation:
</pre>
Performing the size() method will return 3, which indicates 
how many elements the ArrayList stores.
<br> Note that the size() method has no parameters.
<br>
<br>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Finding the indexOf an Element</strong>
</div>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList method: indexOf(obj) </strong>
<br>
<br>
This method returns the index of the object within the targeted ArrayList. 
This is just like the indexOf method for regular arrays and Strings. 
Note that if the object is not found to be present within the ArrayList, the method will return -1 to indicate this. An example of its usage is shown below.
<br>
<br>
Example of indexOf(obj) method:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods9.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>
Example Explanation:
</pre>
Notice that two Mikes are present within the ArrayList names. 
The indexOf method will return the index of Mike's first occurrence. 
In this case, since Mike appears first in index 0, the method will return 0.
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Finding If an Element Exists in an ArrayList</strong>
</div>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Method: contains(obj)</strong>
<br>
<br>
This method returns a boolean (true or false) depending on whether 
the obj is present within the ArrayList. If the obj is present 
within the ArrayList, it will return true. If not, the method will return 
false. Pretty self-explanatory. 
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods10.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>
Example Explanation:
</pre>
Since the contains(obj) method returns a boolean, it can be used as the conditions.
 In the above example, since Jake is not within the "names" ArrayList, the method will return false.
 Since the if statement does not execute, the else print statement is executed instead.
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:3vw;">
<strong>Clearing the Entire ArrayList </strong>
</div>
<br>
<strong>ArrayList Method: clear() </strong>
<br>
<br>
This method clears the entire ArrayList of its contents and returns no value. An example of this is shown below.
<br>
<br>
Example of the clear() method:
<br>
<br>
<img src="../Images/ArrayListMethods11.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;">
<br>
<pre>Example Explanation:</pre>
By performing the clear() method on the "names" ArrayList, 
the entire content in the "names" ArrayList is erased. 
<br>The ArrayList will contain nothing after the method's execution.
