<strong>What Are Arrays?</strong>
<br>
Arrays are a type of data structure that can store a large amount of data 
in a single place. Each data structure comes with its own benefits and disadvantages 
in terms of usability under different circumstances. Having said that, arrays will 
be useful when there is a fixed amount of data input, and not so useful when there is
dynamic data input. The last thing to know about arrays is that they are always objects. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>How Are Arrays Declared in Java?</strong>
<br>
Arrays are declared with the variable type that you want the array to store, followed by square brackets. 
The variable type can be a primitive or an object from the Java API or
a user defined class. Note that an array can ONLY store the data 
type that it was assigned to in its declaration.
<br>
<br><i> Note* If an array is declared but not assigned any value within 
itself, numeric data types will be defaulted to 0, booleans will be 
defaulted to false, and objects (reference types) to null. </i>
<br>
<br><strong>&emsp;Syntax:</strong>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1) There are two ways to declare an array. The first method 
doesn't assign any values to the array, 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;but just declares that it exists, 
and can store <i>sizeOfArray</i> amount of values.
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[sizeOfArray];</strong>
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Example:
<br>
<strong>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int[] num1 = new int [3]; </strong>


<p style="color:green";>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//this array called num1 can hold 3 integers. (These integers have not been assigned). 
</p>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2) The second declaration method assigns values to the array right away. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The array's <i>index</i> (or how many values it can hold) is the number of 
values that you list in the array.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;dataType[] arrayName = {instances of dataType1, instances of dataType2...instances of dataTypeN};
</strong>
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Example:
<br>
<strong>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int[] num2 = {1, 2, 3}; </strong>
<p style="color:green";>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;//This array called num2 stores integers 1, 2, 3. </p>

<br>
<strong>In-Depth Recap: </strong>
<br>The two sides of the assignment symbol (=) signify two steps in 
the process of declaring an array. The left side tells the Java 
Compiler that the name of your array will hold an array of your chosen data type. 
The right side is the actual declaration of the array, signified by the "new" keyword. 
This assigns the arrays to a REFERENCE location in memory, in which the contents of the 
array are stored. Due to these two steps, Java arrays are dynamically allocated. Furthermore, arrays have a 
predetermined size that you give it when its declared, which 
dictates how many elements it can store. 
<br>

<br><strong>Array Indexes</strong>
<br>An array has an <i>index</i> that deternmines the location of a specific element. 
Like Strings, an array's index starts at 0.
<br>
<br>
Given the array: int[] myArray = {10, 20, 30};
<br>
<br>
It's has the following index:
<br>
&emsp;<img src="../Images/array.PNG" alt="" style="width:65%;height:65%;"> 
<br>
<br>
Let's say we want to print the value 20 stored in myArray. 
We can accomplish this by calling myArray's index that contains the value 20. 
This is a similar process with calling specific characters from a String.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;System.out.print(myArray[1]); //outputs 20
<br>
<br>
<strong> Changing An Array's Elements With the Index </strong>
<br>
Besides acessing elements, indexes also give us the ability to change elements in an array.
Consider the following example, where we have a myPets array declared.
Letâ€™s say we want to change "hamster" to "goldfish"- 
we can accomplish this by specifying the array's index
containg <i>hamster</i>, and assigning that element to something new.

<br>
<br>
&emsp;String myPets = {"dog", "cat", "hamster"};
<br>
&emsp;myPets[2] = "goldfish";
<br>
<br>
The element at index 2 of the myPets array is changed to goldfish.
<br>
<br>
<strong> Array Length </strong>
<br>
You can find the length of an array by using the length method. 
<br>IMPORTANT! Unlike strings, the array's length method doesn't have parenthesis!
<br><pre>Arrays:</pre>
&emsp;String myPets = {"dog", "cat", "hamster"};
<br>&emsp;myPets.length; //gives the length/size of the myPets array.
<br>
<br><pre>Strings:</pre>
&emsp;String myString = "hi";
<br>&emsp;myString.length(); //gives the length/size of the myString String.
<br>
<br>
